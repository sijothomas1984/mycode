   Any trace that is in *.pcapng must be first decoded to *.pcap
   this may be completed with the editcap utility. The editcap can be installed with tshark (sudo apt install tshark -y)

   editcap -F libpcap -T ether trace.pcapng trace.pcap
    
   The dpkt library is installed with:

   python3 -m pip install dpkt"""

# standard library
import datetime

# python3 -m pip install dpkt
import dpkt

    # open the trace in read mode, and as a binary file
    # as long as we are indenting the file remains open
    with open('SIP_REGISTER_wp.pcap', 'rb') as f:

        # opens the file object with dpkt and exposes it to
        # the python sub-library "pypcap"
        pcap = dpkt.pcap.Reader(f)

        # ts is a timestamp, and buf is "buffered raw data"
